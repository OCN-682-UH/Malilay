## Introduction
This is my first *Quarto* document and I am going to plot some penguin data

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)

```

## Look at the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

## Make a plot
This is looking at the relationship between **bill length** and **bill depth**.
```{r}
#| message: false
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```
