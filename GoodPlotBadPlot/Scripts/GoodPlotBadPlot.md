# Introduction

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the [NYC Rat Sightings
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/nyc-rat-sightings)
produced by *The City of New York*! This dataset includes sightings of
rats across all five boroughs as reported by the public to 3-1-1 in NYC
from 2010-2017. We‚Äôre going to explore these sightings across the
boroughs to answer the following questions:

- What borough had the highest number of rat sightings from 2010-2017?
- What types of locations do people report the highest sightings of NYC
  rats?

# Load data and take a look

After looking at the data, there are many columns with only **NA** or
**Unspecified** as the values. Let‚Äôs remove those!

``` r
## Load data ######
ratsnyc <- read.csv(here("GoodPlotBadPlot", "Data","Rat_Sightings.csv"))

## Clean data ###
ratsnyc_cleaned <- ratsnyc %>%
  select(where(~!all(is.na(.))), #remove columns where all values are NA
         -starts_with("School")) #remove columns that begin with "School" because all values are Unspecified
```

## BAD RATS ALERT!!

Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to be able to see every single location where a rat
has ever been seen? I personally must know this information.

``` r
## Let's overlay the border of NY state on our map because how else will we know where NY is ##
ny_border <- map_data("state", region = "new york") #make a df to plot the border of ny from mapdata library

geocode("NYC") #find the coordinates for NYC to center map
```

    # A tibble: 1 √ó 2
        lon   lat
      <dbl> <dbl>
    1 -74.0  40.7

``` r
nycmap <- get_map(location = c(lon = -74.00597, lat = 40.71278), #use the output from the nyc geocode
                zoom = 7, #3 is continent level, 20 is singular building
                maptype = "satellite") #choose the base layer image

## Our bad plot #########
NY <- ggmap(nycmap) + #center map on the coords
   geom_rect(aes(xmin = -74.5, xmax = -73.5, #place a rectangle and determine x axis values
                 ymin = 40.3, ymax = 41), #place a rectangle and determine y axis values
             color = "red", #an extremely noticeable border color!    
             linewidth = 1, #line thickness of border  
             fill = NA) + #no fill to see plot
  geom_polygon(data = ny_border, #data for border of NY state
               aes(x = long, y = lat), #place border x and y axis
               color = "green", #the ugliest border color for our state     
               fill = NA, #no fill to see plot
               linewidth = 0.5) + #adjust thickness of line
  coord_map(projection = "mercator") + #determine the map projection
    geom_point(data = ratsnyc_cleaned, #add coordinates
             aes(x = Longitude, 
                 y = Latitude,
                 color = Location.Type)) + #color of points dependent on location type
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "br", #north arrow to bottom right
                         height = unit(3, "cm"), #I love a HUGE north arrow
                         width = unit(3, "cm"),
                         rotation = 180) + #rotate the north arrow because we feel like it!
  labs(title="Rat Sightings across NYC 2010-2017 and Location",
    x = "Latitude", #x-axis label
    y = "Latitude") #y-axis label. Why can't both axes be latitude? fun!
```

### Take a closer look at the locations!

``` r
nycmapdata <- map_data("county") %>% #create a df containing the boroughs, select data from county
  filter(region == "new york") %>% #filter by state
  filter(subregion %in% c("bronx", "kings", "new york", "queens", "richmond")) #filter by specific counties in nyc


NYC <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = nycmapdata, #use df with information on the boroughs
               aes(x = long, y = lat)) + #assign x and y axis
  coord_map(projection = "gilbert") + #choose projection
  theme_void() + #the best theme is one that shows us no coordinates of course
   geom_point(data = ratsnyc_cleaned, # add a point at all my sites 
             aes(x = Longitude, 
                 y = Latitude,
                 color = Park.Borough)) +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "red",
                                   fill = NA, 
                                   linewidth = 3))
```

### THE PLOTS ARE BAD

Well this was really great! Let‚Äôs look at a *HORRIFIC* plot

``` r
BadPlot <- NY/NYC #place plots on top of each other
ggsave(here("GoodPlotBadPlot","Output","BadPlot.png"),width=7,height=7)
```

### Why is our plot so ugly?

- It seems we are unaware of aes(group = group)
- It is impossible to distinguish the points plotted based on location
  type
- Why are we plotting every single sighting of a rat at any point in
  time between 2010-2017?
- Love a giant north arrow pointing south and incorrect labeling of axes
  or lack of labeling
- What is the purpose of color = Park.Borough? This tells us
  <sub>nothing</sub>
- The legends are extremely messy with too much information. It is not
  clear what the purpose of ‚ÄòUnspecified‚Äô is in the bottom plot, or why
  there is a blank value for the top legend.

## Time for a GOOOOOD plot! Clean the Data

ratsnyc_cleaned\$Location.Type has 20 unique values, which crowds up our
plots. Let‚Äôs combine location types to create five concise categories
instead of 20. We also don‚Äôt need to look at every specific date of each
rat sighting throughout the years - instead, we can extract and create a
column for the year of the sighting.

``` r
ratsgoodplot <- ratsnyc_cleaned %>%
  mutate(Created.Date = mdy_hms(Created.Date), #ISO date
    Year = year(Created.Date), #create a column only for year
    ) %>% #create a column only for year
  filter(Park.Borough != "Unspecified") %>% #exclude rows where Park.Borough is Unspecified
  mutate(Combined.Sightings = case_when( #create a column called Combined.Sightings for the five concise categories
    Location.Type %in% c("1-2 Family Dwelling", "1-2 Family Mixed Use Building", 
                         "Single Room Occupancy (SRO)") ~"1-2 Person Residential Building", #if value for location type includes any of the following in c(), assign to 1-2 person residential building
    Location.Type %in% c("3+ Family Mixed Use Building","3+ Family Apt. Building") ~"3+ Person Residential Building", #assign location types to concise category
    Location.Type %in% c("Construction Site", "Catch Basin/Sewer",
                         "Vacant Lot") ~"Outdoor Infrastructure", #assign location types to concise category
    Location.Type %in% c("Parking Lot/Garage", "Public Stairs", 
                         "Summer Camp", "Public Garden") ~"Public Space", #assign location types to concise category
    Location.Type %in% c("Office Building", "Commercial Building", "School/Pre-School",
                         "Government Building", "Hospital", "Day Care/Nursery",
                         "Vacant Building") ~"Mixed-Use Building")) %>% #assign location types to concise category
  drop_na() %>% #remove NA values; we do not have information on "Other(explain below)" 
  group_by(Year, Park.Borough, Combined.Sightings) %>% #group by year, borough, combined sightings to calculate summarise within desired categories
  summarise(Total.Sightings = n()) #create column of total sightings that summarises sihtings across the year, borough, and combined.sightings

### We want a df to answer the question:What borough had the highest number of rat sightings from 2010-2017?###
ratsplot <- ratsgoodplot %>%
  rename(Borough = Park.Borough) %>% #rename for better view on legend
  group_by(Borough, Year) %>% #group by borough and year
  summarise(Grand_Total_Sightings = sum(Total.Sightings)) #total sightings across individual year

## We want a df to answer the question: What types of locations do people report the highest sightings of NYC rats during the year where the most rats were recorded?###
rats2016 <- ratsgoodplot %>%
  filter(Year == 2016) %>% #2016 had the highest sightings of rats across the boroughs
  rename(Location = Combined.Sightings) #rename for better legend legibility
```

### Rat Plotting Time!!

Let‚Äôs plot the total rat sightings of each year from 2010-2017 and
compare across the boroughs. It would also be great to take a closer
look at the year that has the highest rat sightings to evaluate the
types of locations that have high rat sightings.

``` r
## Let's plot the total rat sightings of each year from 2010-2017 and compare across the boroughs######
AllRatSightings <- ggplot(ratsplot,
       aes(x = Year, #see how data changes with time
           y = Grand_Total_Sightings, #total sightings per year
           color = Borough)) + #color dependent on borough
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + #choose distinguishable colors
  geom_point() + #add geometry
  geom_line() + #add geometry
  labs(title="Rat Sightings across NYC 2010-2017", #title                  
     x="Year", #axis name
     y="Total Sightings") + #axis name
  theme_light() + #light theme for legibility 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"), #make the title stand out
        axis.title = element_text(size =13)) #axis title larger for easier read

###Rat sightings in 2016
Rats2016 <- ggplot(rats2016,
       aes(x = Location, y = Total.Sightings, #assign axes 
           fill = Location)) + #fill column color based on location
  geom_col() + #add geometry
  scale_fill_manual(values = mpalette) + #add color palette
  facet_wrap(~Park.Borough) + #compare across boroughs
  coord_flip() + #coord flip because descriptive labels are too long
  labs(title="Rat Sightings across NYC in 2016", 
       subtitle = "2016: The year with the highest total rat sightings across all boroughs",
     x="Location of Sighting",
     y="Total Sightings",
     caption="Data collected by the City of New York via 3-1-1 reports") +
  theme_light() + #add visually peasing theme
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"), #make title more visible
        axis.title = element_text(size =13),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 12)) 
```

### A MUCH BETTER PLOT

``` r
GoodPlot <- AllRatSightings/Rats2016
ggsave(here("GoodPlotBadPlot","Output","GoodPlot.png"),width=7,height=5)
```

### Why is our plot MUCH BETTER?

- Clear total number of sightings based on borough and year, unlike our
  **?@fig-combined-bad-plots** where the coordinates of sightings were
  mixed across every year
- The plot is faceted by borough to make it easier to make side by side
  comparisons of sightings across the boroughs side
- Labeling, the legend, title, and axes are all clear to the reader due
  to choices with sizing, bolding, and naming
- Choice of colors and themes for the plots allows us to visually
  distinguish the data
